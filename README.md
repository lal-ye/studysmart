## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version X.X.X or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   Firebase account and project setup. Refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) for details.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/learnflow-ai.git
    cd learnflow-ai
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Firebase configuration and other necessary API keys.
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    # Add any Genkit related API keys if necessary
    GENKIT_API_KEY=your_genkit_api_key
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

2.  **Running the Genkit Development Server (if applicable):**
    If your project uses Genkit with a local development server for AI flows, you might need to run it separately.
    ```bash
    # Command to start Genkit development server (e.g., genkit start)
    # Please refer to your project's specific Genkit setup.
    ```
    Ensure your Next.js application is configured to communicate with the Genkit server endpoint.
